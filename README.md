cpp compiler in rust


#basic components of a compiler:

Lexer: Breaks the source code into tokens.
Parser: Converts the tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
Semantic Analysis: Ensures the AST is semantically correct.
Intermediate Representation (IR): Transforms the AST into an intermediate representation for optimization.
Optimizer: Improves the IR without changing its meaning.
Code Generator: Converts the optimized IR into target machine code.
Linker: Combines multiple object files into a single executable.

#Rust project using cargo:
cargo new cpp_compiler --bin
cd cpp_compiler

#a parser that will use the tokens produced by the lexer to create an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
// src/parser.rs

#Semantic Analysis
This stage checks the correctness of the AST, ensuring that it adheres to C++'s semantic rules.
// src/semantic.rs

#Generating Intermediate Representation (IR)
Transform the AST into an IR, such as LLVM IR, which is a low-level representation of your code.
// src/ir.rs

#Code Generation
Finally, write the code generator to produce machine code from the IR.
// src/codegen.rs

#Linking
Combine the generated machine code with other object files or libraries to produce the final executable.
// src/linker.rs

#Main Program
Your main program ties everything together.
// src/main.rs

#Adding Support for a Simple HTML/JS/CSS Server
To make your C++ compiler capable of serving a basic website, you can include a simple HTTP server that delivers static files (like index.html, script.js, and style.css). You can use a library like tiny-http in Rust for this purpose.
